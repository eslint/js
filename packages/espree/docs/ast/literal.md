# Literal

A `Literal` node represents a literal value in JavaScript. Literal values are:

- Boolean values - `true` and `false`
- Numeric values such as `1` and `10.0`
- String values such as `"foo"`
- Regular expressions such as `/foo/g`.

Literal AST nodes have the following properties:

- `type` - always `"Literal"`
- `value` - the JavaScript representation of the literal if it's possible to create. For instance, this will be a JavaScript number if the literal represents a number, a regular expression if the literal represents a regular expression and the current engine can properly create the regular expression object, and so on.
- `regex` - only present for regular expression literals and has the following properties:
    - `pattern` - the regular expression pattern.
    - `flags` - any flags applied to the pattern.

**Note:** The `regex` property is a custom property and is not present in the SpiderMonkey Parser API.

Additionally, literal AST nodes have all the standard properties of nodes. Here's a complete example:

```json
{
	"range": [10, 16],
	"loc": {
		"start": {
			"line": 1,
			"column": 10
		},
		"end": {
			"line": 1,
			"column": 16
		}
	},
	"type": "Literal",
	"value": null,
	"regex": {
		"pattern": "foo",
		"flags": "y"
	},
	"raw": "/foo/y"
}
```
